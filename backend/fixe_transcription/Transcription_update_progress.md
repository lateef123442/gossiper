I've successfully optimized the AssemblyAI transcription service with comprehensive improvements while maintaining your existing Supabase Realtime architecture. The enhancements include: enhanced database schema with quality metrics (confidence, word/character counts, processing times), comprehensive TypeScript types for better type safety, simple validation utilities that are easy to maintain, analytics foundation for future reporting features, and optimized Supabase Realtime hook with reconnection logic and deduplication. The callback route now immediately writes enhanced data to the database which Supabase Realtime automatically broadcasts to all connected clients, eliminating any need for polling or custom WebSocket infrastructure.
